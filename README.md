Project Description:

- Our idea is based on wireless EV charging lanes

- Our application will tell you about the all over fare and the time to be taken by the EV to get fuly charged while on the go.

- Also for the hardware implementation the EV will be charged wirelessly and for more details you can visit our video presentation in which we demonstrated how all the process will work!

Challenges we faced and features we hope to implement in future:

- It was hard to find exact resources since it was a new concept.
- We studied from different patents for the reliability of the technology to be used.
- We are thinking to implement a smart AI trip planner for the betterment of user experience.
